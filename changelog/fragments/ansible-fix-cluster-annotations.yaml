      header: Ensure that existing dependent resources have owner annotations
      body: >
        Ansible-based operators use owner references (for resources in the same
        namespace) and owner annotations(for cluster scoped resources and
        resources in other namespaces). If dependent resources were created
        without the references/annotations, they cannot be cleaned up by the
        operator, and update/deletes will not trigger a reconcile. Follow these
        instructions to add owner references/annotations to existing objects.
